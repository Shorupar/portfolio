        <h2>Tilicho Lake</h2>
        <p>
            Tilicho Lake trek is a journey to the world’s highest glacial lake Tilicho with an altitude of 4949 meters. 
            Tilicho Lake is one of the Highest elevated lakes in Nepal and perhaps in the world too. The Tilicho lake 
            is elevated to a height of 4,949 Meters but some other sources say it is 4,919 Meters. Lake Tilicho with an area 
            of 1.853 mi² is just in front of Tilicho Peak. The way to Tilicho is amazing because you can see an amazing view 
            of Mt Himlung and Mt Manaslu together with many other small peaks located on the border between Annapurna and 
            Manaslu Range. The Lake is filled with blue glaciers waters and there is no place that you can see the water discharge. 
            Many hikers visit Tilicho lake which takes about 3-4 days from the Annapurna circuit trek to see the Immense beauty of Tilicho Lake.
