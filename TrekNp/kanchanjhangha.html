        <h2>kanchanjangha Base Camp</h2>
        <p>       
            Kanchenjunga Base Camp, located in eastern Nepal, serves as the primary staging area for climbers aiming to summit Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world. 
            Positioned at an altitude of approximately 5,143 meters (16,873 feet) for the North Base Camp, it offers trekkers and climbers stunning views of the surrounding peaks and glaciers. 
            Kanchenjunga base camp trek is a superb trek in the east of Nepal, of actual trekking covering 220 km in an area which is far less visited by tourists and includes a wide range of wonderful scenery from lush, tropical jungle through to rhododendron, chestnut and oak forests and high onto the glaciated base camp of the third highest peak in the world.

      <u><li><p>Flight form Kathmandu to bhadrapur and drive to Taplejung(1820 m) <br></u>
        Today, we will fly from Kathmandu (TIA) to Bhadrapur (Chandragadhi Airport on a domestic flight of about 45 to 50 minutes. We will take a local jeep and drive through Kanyam. 
        We drive via Mechi Highway from Kanyam viewing the tea cultivations on the way toward Taplejung from where the trek to Kanchenjunga Circuit Trek begins.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p> Taplejung to Sekathum (1650m) <br></u>
        We will have our breakfast and catch the local jeep and begin our second-day ride to reach our destination for the day, Sekathum. Usually, trekkers prefer to walk up to Sekathum from Taplejung but by making our itinerary short and utilizing the available services in the region, we reach Sekathum two days before other trekkers. 
        The drive will take us through Mitlung, Chirwa, Thapethok, Lelep, and several other villages along the Tamor Nadi. 
        There is the Kanchenjunga National Park entry point on our way, where our permits are checked and allowed to move forward to Sekathum.
            </p></li>                
      <u> <li><p>   Sekathum to Amjilosa (2498m)<br></u>
        After two days of the drive, we will start our hike with breakfast at Sekathum. 
        The Himalayas' adventurous journey begins with an ascent along the Ghunsa Khola and walking over many bridges along the way, exploring through verdant trees, 
        the little settlements of Jonggim, and Ghaiyabari reaching Amjilosa. </p></li>                
       <u><li><p>      Amjilosa to Gyabla (2725m) <br></u>
        We move forward to Gyabla which is also known as Kyapra from Amjilosa after having breakfast. We continue to move in our path through a dense forest and trail without a Human settlement. 
        Today, we can spot Red Pandas during our hike on the Kanchenjunga Trail, if we got lucky. After the uphill climb, we get to view the magnificent sceneries of the mountains and several waterfalls on the way.
         We slowly make our way and reach Gyabla village. </p></li>                
       <u><li><p>Gyabla to Ghunsa (3415m) <br></u>
        The walk through the woodlands with a wide range of flora and fauna leads us to the Phale village.
         Continuing the trek at a pace, we will reach Ghunsa village. 
        Many trekkers stop at Ghunsa for acclimatization, but we have our acclimation day at Khambachen. </p></li>                
      <u>  <li><p>   Ghunsa to Khambachen (4145m) <br></u>
        We will have our breakfast and begin the gradual ascent through an open pine forest and also have the chance to spot blue sheep and snow leopards. The trail passes through landslide-prone areas. 
        We see the spectacular view of Mt. Jannu, encounter the green glacier valleys, and finally reach Khambachen village.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p>   Khambachen to Lhonak (4792m)<br></u>
        We move ahead to the trail of the Kanchenjunga glacier. We can meet the trekkers in the main trekking season walking toward and returning from the Kanchenjunga North Base Camp on this track.
         We move through the Ramdang and come across the Ramdang Monastery. We are on the difficult trail, now at the junction of the Lhonak and Kanchenjunga glaciers.
         Walking forward, we reach the tiny settlement of Lhonak with a few teahouses.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p>Hike to Kanchenjunga North base camp (5143m.|16873ft.) and return to Lhonak (9km) <br></u>
        Today, we will hike to the north base camp of Mt. Kanchenjunga, which is also known as Pang Pema. We will climb gradually following the moraines through the trail and reach Kanchenjunga Base Camp.
         The prayer flags around and the mesmerizing towering third-highest mount Kanchenjunga is the reward after multiple days of trekking. 
        We will return to Lhonak for an overnight stay.</p></li>                
      <u> <li><p>   Lhonak to Ghunsa (3415m)<br></u>
        Rejoicing the views of the Himalayas and leaving behind the Kanchenjunga Base Camp, retracing the track, we arrive at Ghunsa. 
        The Kanchenjunga trail gives us memories of walking passing the stone huts, soaring mountain peaks, rocky fields nearby the trails, rock-falling zones, etc.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p>Trek to Sele Le Base Camp (4240m)<br></u>
        We arrive at Sele Le, leaving the trail to Gyabla. There is a chance to see the snow leopards as we pass through the dense forest.
         There are isolated human settlements with few teahouses which are open only in the main trekking season. When there is heavy snowfall there is no other way connecting the pathway to reach South Base Camp until Sekathum. 
        If the teahouses are closed and still we can cross the passes then, we can even reach Tseram in a day cutting a day off from our planned itinerary.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p>Trek from Sele Le Base Camp to Tseram (3868m)<br></u>
Leaving Sele Le Pass, we will hike up to the high-altitude passes, Sinion La (4440m.|2758ft.), then Mirgin La (4480m.|2783ft.) and Sinelapche Bhanjyang (4645m.|2886ft.). We will see the spectacular panoramic view of Mt. Jannu, Everest, Makalu, Baruntse, Chamlang, and Kanchenjunga during our ascent. We descend to Tseram and stay overnight over there.
        </p></li>                
      <u>  <li><p>Trek from Tseram to Ramche and Hike to Oktang (Yalung South Base Camp Viewpoint, 4740m) and back to Tseram<br></u>
        Today, after early morning breakfast, we head forward through the Yalung glacier getting higher and close to the vistas. Passing by the Yalung which provides views of Rathong (6682m) and Kabru (7412m), we will stop for lunch at Ramche. We will hike to Oktang/ Okhordung the viewpoint of Yalung Base Camp or Kanchenjunga South Base Camp.
         Enjoying the closer view of three summits of Mt. Kanchenjunga 8420m, 8586m, and 8474m, and other towering peaks, exploring this untouched, unexplored by many trekkers, Kanchenjunga Base Camp, we will return to Tseram.  </p></li>    
         <u> <li><p> Trek from Tseram to Tortong (2980m)<br></u>
            The elevated snow-capped mountains behind us and the walk through the rhododendron forests give us tranquility. 
            Our trek starts downhill and ends at Tortong passing through Simbuwa Khola with enchanting views of the Himalayas en route. 
            We will stay overnight at Tortong.
                    </p></li> 
                    <u> <li><p> Trek from Tortong to Yamphudin (1692m)<br></u>
                        From Tortong, we persist to descend to the Amji Khola passing through Lasiya/Lamite Bhanjyang (3415m) and Dhupi Bhanjyang (2665m). 
                        Walking past the steep slope area, we reach Yamphudin village. 
                        There is the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area checkpost in Yamphudin, 
                        where our permits are checked if we had begun our trek with Kanchenjunga South Base Camp first.
                                </p></li> 
                                <u> <li><p>  Yamphudin to Kanyam (1210m)<br></u>
                                    After having breakfast in Yamphudin, we start exploring beautiful landscapes through the trails, and trekking alongside the pathway of Kabeli Khola. Leaving the mountain villages, we will take a drive to Kanyam,
                                     a beautiful place surrounded by tea gardens. Along the way to Kanyam, we can see the cardamom and tea cultivation through our windows. Keeping the bittersweet memories of the trek at the high altitudes, we are now at the lowlands.
                                     You can encounter many local tourists as Kanyam is a popular destination with tea gardens.
                                            </p></li> 
                                            <u> <li><p>Drive from Kanyam to Bhadrapur and late afternoon flight back to Kathmandu (1400m)<br></u>
                                              
                                                        We will have our breakfast and explore the green tea cultivation area for a while. Then, we will have a 2-3 hour drive to Bhadrapur.
                                                         We will have a 45 to 50 minutes flight from Bhadrapur to Kathmandu in the late afternoon.</p></li>
