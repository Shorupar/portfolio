        <h2>Dolpo</h2>
        <p>
            Dolpo is a high-altitude culturally Tibetan region in the upper part of the Dolpa District of western Nepal, bordered in the north by China.Part of the region lies in Shey Phoksundo National Park
            on the other.The Dolpo are generally adherents of Bon, a religion whose origins predate Buddhism but whose modern form is officially accepted as a fifth school of Tibetan Buddhism. The remote region has preserved its Tibetan culture in relatively pure form, making it attractive to Westerners.

Then, we will follow the trail along Phoksundo river. Furthermore, we will witness a drastic change in the landscape, walking through the lush tropical forest. We will pass Kageni, Jutung and Shangta.
             We will cross bridge over Phoksundo lake and at the confluence of Phoksundo and Maiba Khola</p></li>

            Then, we will ascend the final part of today’s trek and reach Sallaghari.</p></li>
