        <h2>Upper Mustang</h2>
        <p>       
            Upper Mustang is a remote and culturally rich region located in the north-central part of Nepal, bordering Tibet. It is known for its unique Tibetan Buddhist culture, stunning landscapes, and ancient monasteries. 
            This area was a restricted demilitarized zone until 1992, which has helped preserve its traditional Tibetan culture and way of life.
            The Upper Mustang trek in to the remote Trans-Himalayan Region of this semi-independent Tibetan Kingdom offers an adventurous 14 day itinerary with spectacular trekking through striking semi-arid desert with colourful rock formations, deep ravines and snow-capped peaks surrounding you.
             The history, culture, myth and legend blends perfectly with the stunning scenery.
