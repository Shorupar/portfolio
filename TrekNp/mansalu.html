        <h2>Manaslu himal</h2>
        <p>       
            The Manaslu Trek in Nepal is a remarkable journey that takes you around the stunning Manaslu Peak, the eighth highest mountain in the world. This trek offers a perfect blend of rich cultural heritage, pristine natural beauty, and a challenging adventure.
            Trekkers will pass through diverse landscapes, including lush forests, terraced fields, and high mountain passes. The trail also takes you through traditional Tibetan and Nepalese villages, offering a unique cultural experience.
            With fewer crowds compared to other popular treks in Nepal, the Manaslu Trek provides an authentic and serene trekking experience.
            The Manaslu Circuit trek is a stunning 13-day journey (18 days including travel and days in Kathmandu) which treks around the worldâ€™s eighth highest mountain, beginning in the busy market town of Soti Khola, going up and back along a different path, ending in Syange. 
            This is a trek for someone who wants something different in Nepal but still offers the most striking and jaw-dropping scenery.
            Many people liken the Manaslu Circuit trek to the Annapurna before it got busy! It is in a region which was closed to outsiders until the early 90's and tourism is still restricted. It is also not quite as high as the Annapurna circuit and really is a stunning and less trodden path.

        <h2>Manaslu Trek Guide</h2>
        <ul>
            <img src="manaslu-circuit-trek-map.jpg" alt="map">
      <u><li><p>Kathmandu to Macha khola (890 m) <br></u>
            You will board a public bus to Machha Khola after breakfast in Kathmandu, passing through Arughat and Soti Khola to officially begin your Manaslu Circuit Trekking Itinerary. It will be a lengthy journey, with the first part of the journey being smooth over a blacktop major roadway to Arughat, and the second half of the journey being challenging from Arughat. As you go over the rocky road to Maccha Khola, be ready to bounce your body with some actions.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p>Trek from Macha khola(890m) to jagat (1340m) <br></u>
            Along the Budhi Gandaki River, you will continue on the trek. The Manaslu Circuit Trek route travels through Khorlabesi, ascending and descending at small altitudes, until arriving at Tatopani, a hot spring. You will be amazed by the breathtaking scenery at Doban, Thulo Dunga, and Yaru Bagar as you traverse a mountain and cross the Budhi Gandaki River. The path twist and turn across the river, passing across multiple suspension bridges until arriving at the Manaslu Conservation Area's entrance gate, where you will register your permits at a police checkpoint in Jagat. 
            </p></li>                
      <u> <li><p>Trek from Jagat (1340m) to Deng (1860m)<br></u>
            The trek starts over a stony ridge, with a glimpse of Sringi Himal in the distance. You will voyage via Salleri, Sirdibas, and Ghatta Khola before arriving at Philim, a Gurung settlement. Then, via Ekle Bhatti, your Manaslu Circuit Trek Route will go to Nyak village, crossing the Budhi Gandaki River twice over suspension bridges. 
            After traveling through a desolate canyon and following the Budhi Gandaki's bank pathways, you will arrive in Deng village through Pewa Khola and bamboo forests.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p> Trek from Deng (1860m) to Namrung (2630m) <br></u>
            Manaslu Circuit Trek will begin in Deng and proceed up to Rana and Bihi Phedi, passing a suspension bridge across the Budhi Gandaki River. This trek will climb steadily and pass through a variety of woodlands and mani stones before arriving in the lovely hamlet of Ghap. After that, you will go to Ghapsya, taking in the spectacular vistas of Shringi Himal along the route. The landslide area will begin at Ghapsya, so be careful.
             You will rise to Namrung by following the river and crossing it many times through the forest and gompas.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p> Trek from Namrung (2630m) to Lho (3180m) <br></u>
            You will hike a difficult trail through a forested region from Namrung to Lihi, with beautiful vistas of mountains such as Saula Himal, Pangkar Himal, Kutang Himal, and Pangbuche Himal. Beautiful chortens and barley fields, as well as a sight of the Manaslu Himal, can be seen from Lihi. As your Manaslu Circuit Trekking trail progresses, you will notice a shift in the vegetation and meet more Buddhists. 
            You will reach Lho village after going via Sho Village, where you can observe Punggen Glacier.</p></li>                
      <u>  <li><p>  Trek from Lho (3180m) to Samagaon (3520m) <br></u>
From Lho to Samagaon, it will be a short climb. On the Manaslu Circuit Trek route to Samagaon, you will travel via Shyala village, which has amazing sceneries, gompas, Tibetan communities, and alpine beauty. From Samagaon, you will have a close-up glimpse of Mt. Manaslu during this walk. Village entrance gates are widespread, and you may witness village ladies spinning wool into dresses or buying Chinese whiskey on the street.
You could have some free time after your delicious lunch. You might thus take use of that time by taking a quick stroll to Birendra Lake or Pungyen Gompa. The Buddhist temple at Pung Gyan Gompa is surrounded by numerous tall mountains, making it the ideal site to spend some time in. The same goes for Birendra Lake, which is approximately an hour's walk from Samagaon and offers a stunning vista of blue and green colored lake water.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p> Trek from Samagaon (3520m) to Samdo (3860m)<br></u>
            To get to Samdo, you will have to ascend steeply on an isolated trail. Manaslu Circuit Trekking trail will take you along the Budhi Gandaki River and through a lovely woodland with Rhododendron, Juniper, and Birch trees. The valley widens before approaching Kermo Kharka and the white Kani Gateway. The path's attractiveness is enhanced by the mani walls that border it. As you continue on, you will reach Samdo, which is only 4 kilometers from the Tibetan border. Mt. Manaslu, Simnang Himal, Ngadi Chuli, Manaslu glacier, Manaslu icefall, and other Himalayan peaks can all be seen from here, as well as a Tibetan refugee community.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p> Acclimatization Day at Samdo (3875m) <br></u>
            Samdo is the final village before the Larkya La Pass, where you will spend the day adjusting to the altitude. As per your Manaslu Circuit Trek Itinerary, today is your acclimatization day.
             You will have the chance to visit Samdo Village, which is situated close to the magnificent Samdo Peak and Samdo Glacier. Additionally, you have the option of using Lajyung Pass or Rui La Pass to go to the Tibetan border. With breathtaking views of Mt. Manaslu, Simrang, Hiuchuli, Larkya Peak, Cheo, and Ngadi, you may explore the villages, flora, and animals. The longer path to Gya La can be hiked as an alternative.</p></li>                
      <u> <li><p> Trek from Samdo (3860m) to Larkya Phedi (4480m)<br></u>
            The hike is short today, so you will have plenty of time to get used to the altitude. The Manaslu Circuit Trek continues across hills and over wooden bridges across the Budi Gandaki. The Larkya glacier will be reached after crossing two streams, followed by a stunning valley. The views of Manaslu and the Syacha Glacier are spectacular on this trail. On the way to Dharamshala, if you are lucky, you could see Himalayan blue sheep. Peaks like Jarkya Himal, Nysing Himal, and Lajyung Himal, as well as glaciers like Fukang Glaciers, Larkya Glacier, Syacha Glacier, Yamnang Glacier, and Manaslu Glacier, can all be seen from Dharamshala.</p></li>                
       <u><li><p>Trek from Larkya Phedi (4480m) to Bimthang (3720m) via Larkya La Pass (5106m)<br></u>
            The most anticipated day of the Manaslu Circuit Trek is when you will pass Larkya La Pass (5160m), the trek's highest point. Cho Chanda will be climbed first, followed by a gradual ascent to the high snow-covered pass. From the summit, the panoramic views of the mountains are simply breathtaking. The Himlung, Cheo, Gyagi Kung, Kang Koru, and Annapurna II are just a few of the snow-capped Himalayas you will see. After that, it's a hard drop across moraines to Bhimphedi.
             From Bhimphedi, visitors may see glaciers like Dobhan, Purdi, and Ponkar, as well as small lakes like Ponkar and Nayamlo.</p></li>                
       <u> <li><p> Trek from Bimthang (3720m) to Dharapani (1963m)<br></u>
            This is the last day of trekking in the Manaslu region as you can see in the Manaslu Circuit Trek Itinerary. The descent from Bimthang passes through high-grazing grassland, Dudh Khola, and rhododendron woodland, with views of Manaslu, Lamjung Himal, Himlung Himal, and Cheo Himal. First and foremost, after passing Dobhan and Purdi Khola, you will descend from Bimthang to Hampuk hamlet.
            Then, on your way to Gho Village, you will travel through Yak Kharka and Kharche, as well as the magnificent streams Soti Khola and Kasongto Khola. To go to Dharapani, follow Dudh Khola from Gho Village and cross Tilije and Thonje villages. The trek to Dharapani necessitates crossing the Marsyangdi River on a suspension bridge. 
            You will arrive at the Annapurna Circuit trek's intersection, where the hiking will get easy before plunging to Bensi Sahar and eventually Kathmandu.</p></li>                
      <u>  <li><p>Drive Back to Kathmandu (1400m) or Pokhara (822m) from Dharapani (1963m) <br></u>
            Finally, you will say your goodbyes to Dharapani and board a shared jeep to Besi Sahar. From Besi Sahar to Kathmandu or Pokhara, you will take a public bus.</p></li>
