        <h2>Khumai Dada Trek Guide</h2>
        <ul>
            <img src="khumaimap.jpg" alt="map">
        <li><p><u>Drive from Kathmandu (1,300m) to Pokhara City (850m)</u><br>
            This day begins with a delicious breakfast and then a long drive to the lake city called Pokhara. During the drive, 
            you get to see beautiful views of rivers and small settlement areas. lush green hills, and waterfalls. Upon reaching Pokhara, 
            you head to the hotel. You are free to explore nearby areas. If you want, you can also do boating on the tranquil Fewa Lake 
            enjoying a stunning sunset. </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>from Pokhara to Hemja and trek to Hile Kharka (2160m) via Ghachowk </u><br>
            You will take a 30-minute journey from Pokhara to Hemja on the second day of your trek. The hike begins at Hemja, from which 
            you will begin trekking through the forests, hamlets, and terraced farms while taking in the views of the surrounding hills. 
            The Hemja to Hile Kharka hike is a six-hour walk that is moderately difficult. On the route to Hile Kharka, Ghachowk regarded 
            as the ideal location to view the Himalayas is located. In order to fully appreciate the views of Macchapuchre, Annapurna, and 
            Lamjung Himal from Ghachowk, please take your time and go slowly.</p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek from Hile to Khumai Danda (3245m)</u><br>
            Since you will be moving through the forest for most of the hike from Hile Kharka to Kumai Dada, it will feel like a jungle walk. 
            The track is serene and a little more difficult than the trek from the day before because it becomes smaller and is also covered 
            in a grassy hill. The panoramic views of Macchapuchre, Dhaulagiri, and Annapurna will reward and greet you at their best despite 
            a few difficulties. You will eventually reach Khumai Danda, which is located in the shadow of the enormous Macchapuchre Himal, 
            after passing the Samsur Deurali.</p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Hike to Korchan Danda (3700m) and hike down to Ghachowk and drive to Pokhara </u><br>
            The trip's main feature, Korchan Danda, will definitely stun you with its breathtaking views of the Himalayas and the sunrise. 
            The slope, which rises to a height of 3700 meters, provides magnificent views of Macchapuchre, Annapurna, and Mardi. Before 
            returning to Pokhara, you can spend some time together away from the bustle, in the lap of the Himalayas.</p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Drive from Pokhara City (850m) to Kathmandu (1,300m) </u><br>
            The trail descends to Nayapul. You trek through the forested path and small villages before reaching Nayapul. From here, you 
            drive back to Pokhara. Spend the night enjoying a gorgeous sunset view over tranquil Fewa Lake and dining in a fine restaurant 
            or cafe.</p></li>
