            major tributaries of the Thuli Bheri River; and the Langu Rilver, which drains the high dolpo plateau to the east and flows westward.

            parks in the world. Ringmo village, a typical Tibetan village, is scenically nestled in the area. Many beautiful glaciers can be found 
            near and above the lake area. The Park contain many Gompas (Monasteries) and religious area. The most famous, Shey Gompa was 
            established in the 11th Century. Thashung Gompa located near Phoksundo Lake was built about 900 years ago to conserve wildlife. <br>

            several waterfalls along the way. Trekking to Phoksundo Lake offers stunning mountain views of snow-capped mountains like Kanjiroba and 
            an exciting walk along the Thulo Bheri and Suligad rivers. It is a short and relatively easy trip to one of Nepal's largest and most spectacular lakes.
