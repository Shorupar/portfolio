        <h2>Langtang Valley Trek</h2>
        <p>
            Langtang Valley also known as Lamtang Valley is a Himalayan valley in the mountains of north-central Nepal, known for its 
            trekking routes and natural environment. Langtang Valley Trek is a congenial delightful and ideal journey in the Langtang region. 
            It is famous for providing exceptionally beautiful vistas of the mountains, native hidden culture, and Langtang Himalayas ranges. 
            The Langtang Trekking Trail is an extremely beautiful and fascinating destination in Nepal. <br>
            Langtang is situated north of Kathmandu and borders Tibet. The terrain is mountainous but not precipitous with forests, terraced 
            hill slopes and valley paths leading to high pastures and eventually the moraine of the glaciers and peaks. It does not reach the 
            same heights as the treks in the Khumbu valleys and therefore has far less of the altitude related issues. The Tamang Heritage trail 
            visits an area where the people who originally came from Tibet as horse traders settled in Nepal several hundred years ago. They have 
            a distinct Tibetan identity with Tibetan and their own language with colourful dancing and interesting customs.

        <h2>Langtang Trek Guide</h2>
        <ul>
            <img src="Langtangmap.jpg" alt="map">
        <li><p><u>Drive from Kathmandu (1400m / 4,393ft) to Syabrubesi (1,503m / 4,655ft)</u> <br>
            After early morning breakfast, the drive to Syabrubesi begins. We head north out of Kathmandu. During the journey, 
            you can catch fantastic views of rivers, terraced fields, small villages, and snow-capped mountains. The road takes 
            you to a small town - Dhunche. While on the road that follows Trishuli River banks, you will catch glimpses of Ganesh 
            Himal 7,422 m (24,350 ft). From Dhunche, we continue the drive until we reach Syabrubesi. You can explore this town for 
            a while but do not forget to experience the riverside hot spring. </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek From Syabrubesi (1,503m / 4,655ft) to Lama Hotel (2,470m / 8,103ft)</u> <br>
            We begin our trek from Syabrubesi, following Bhote Kosi and Langtang Rivers passing through fertile jungles, terraced fields, 
            and rural settlements rich in bamboo and birch groves. You might spot rare wild lives like the red panda from the path. After 
            a while, the trek ascends gently to Rimche (2,400m / 7,874ft) through dense bamboo fields alongside the banks of Langtang River. 
            We continue on our route until we reach Lama Hotel - the destination for the day.</p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek from Lama Hotel (2,470m / 8,103ft) to Langtang village (3,430m / 11,255ft)</u> <br>
            We begin our day with an early morning breakfast and start trekking alongside a river through the lush landscape, climbing upward 
            through the dense forests. Along the way, you might see the snowy peaks ahead if the weather is favorable. Ultimately the narrow 
            river valley broadens out at Ghoda Tabela (3,030m). In the past, there was a Tibetan resettlement project running here, but currently, 
            Ghoda Tabela has an army check post where we will register our papers. In addition to the army check post, there are a few lodges here.
            As we trek further, we will come across Chyamki village (3,230m) - a small settlement and walk past Chortens, water mills, mani walls, 
            and prayer wheels, which signals we are nearing Langtang Village. We continue past prayer wheels driven by flowing water and prayer 
            flags to scenic Langtang, a large settlement of mostly Tamang people. </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek from Langtang village (3,430m / 11,255ft) to Kyanjin Gompa (3,865m / 12,675ft)</u> <br>
            The trek today will be short and easy. We will pass by many small plateaus, big mani walls, yak pastures, small villages, and meadows. 
            Since we will be gaining elevation, we trek slowly so that our bodies can acclimatize. After hiking for a while, we will come across 
            water mills, prayer wheels, sacred mounds of rocks with inscriptions carved on them. It signals that we have reached the ancient 
            monastery- Kyanjin Gompa (3,830m / 12,565 ft). Kyanjin Gompa lies surrounded by the Himalayas, and from here, we get stunning views 
            of several snow-capped peaks. </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Exploration day at Kyanjin Gompa</u> <br>
            We can rest for a day to acclimatize and explore this beautiful Langtang region. The Langtang valley has so much to offer for trekkers. 
            Higher elevation means you will be getting stunning views of the Himalayas ranges and glaciers. You will be visiting Kyanjin Gompa and 
            observing monks offering their prayers. The cheese factory would also be another interesting site to visit. We can also hike to Langshisa 
            Kharka and the viewpoint of Tserko Ri (5,450m/17,880ft)- the highest point of this trek. Tserko Ri is the perfect viewpoint to admire peaks 
            like Langtang Lirung (7,227m), Langtang II (6,586m), and many more. Yet another viewpoint - Kyanjin Ri (4,773m / 15,655 ft) provides majestic 
            views of the Langtang range. As the sun begins to set, we will return to Kyanjin Gompa for the night.</p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek from Kyanjin Gompa (3,865m / 12,675ft) to Lama Hotel (2,470m / 8,103ft)</u> <br>
            We will leave Kyangjin Gompa admiring the last glimpse of the beautiful mountains standing with pride and glory. But it is time for 
            us to retrace the previous route we took to Langtang Village, and we will stop at Ghoda Tabela for lunch. The army check post at Ghoda 
            Tabela will also register our exit. After a leisurely lunch, we continue down through the dense river valley forests to Lama Hotel, 
            where we will be staying for the night.
        </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Trek from Lama Hotel (2,470m / 8,103ft) to Syabrubesi (1,420m / 4,655ft)</u> <br>
            We being the final trekking day, we head to Syabrubensi to drive back to Kathmandu. We will be walking along the Langtang River, 
            heading downwards to the beautiful river valley. As you descend through bamboo and birch forests, you will see amazing landscapes and 
            cross the Langtang and Bhote Koshi rivers to reach Syabrubesi. This marks the end of our trekking journey. The next day we will be 
            driving back to Kathmandu. </p></li>                
        <li><p><u>Drive from Syabrubesi (1,420m / 4,655ft) to Kathmandu (1400m / 4,393ft)</u> <br>
            We will drive from Syabrubensi to Kathmandu, which will take about seven to nine hours. This drive begins early morning. During this 
            drive, you will be getting scenic views of the Trishuli river valley as we head south from the hills. Along the way, you will see 
            terraced farmlands, meadows, and hopefully final glimpses of the snow-capped mountains. Once we arrive in Kathmandu, we will drop 
            you at your hotel. </p></li>
